/*
ðŸ§  Analogy:
Think of the array as a mountain range. Youâ€™re hiking through it and canâ€™t see the whole view â€” only your current position and one step left and right.

You always move towards the higher slope:

If the right side is higher, climb right.

If the left side is higher, climb left.

If youâ€™re at a local peak, stop.

This "greedy climbing" with binary direction halves the search space each time â€” just like binary search.
