/*
    üîç Intuition:
    This is a variation of binary search applied to a rotated sorted array
    which may contain duplicates. Normally, in a rotated sorted array,
    one half is guaranteed to be sorted. But when duplicates exist,
    we can't always determine which half is sorted, especially when
    arr[low] == arr[mid] == arr[high].

    üß† Approach:
    - Perform standard binary search with conditions adjusted for rotation.
    - If we can determine the sorted half (left or right), check if the target
   lies within it.
    - If duplicates make it ambiguous (i.e., arr[low] == arr[mid] or arr[mid] ==
   arr[high]), then shrink the search space linearly by moving low or high
   inward by 1.
    - This degrades to O(n) in worst-case scenarios (e.g., all elements are the
   same), but performs close to O(log n) in average cases.

    ‚ö†Ô∏è Edge Cases:
    - The array contains only one or two elements.
    - All elements are the same.
    - Target is at the pivot (rotation point).
    - Target is not present at all.
    - Duplicates surround the mid-point, making it ambiguous which side is
   sorted.
